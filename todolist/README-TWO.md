## Describe the difference between asynchronous programming with synchronous programming ?
Synchronous: In Synchronous Transmission,Frames or blocks of data are sent. Full-duplex transmission is being used here. Synchronization between the sender and receiver is necessary.
There is no lag in synchronous transmission when it comes to data.

Asynchronous: In Asynchronous Transmission, Data is transmitted as either bytes or characters. Half-duplex transmission is the type used in this. Start bits and stop bits are combined with the data in this transmission.
It doesn't need to be synchronized.

##  Explain Event-Driven Programming ?
The goal of event-driven programming is to keep the program as straightforward as possible while synchronizing the occurrence of numerous events. 
These are the fundamental elements of an event-driven program:
- When an event is triggered, a callback function (also known as an event handler) is invoked.
- an event loop that calls the appropriate event handler for each event as it is triggered.

## Describe the implementation of asynchronous programming in AJAX
Asynchronous Javascript & XML (AJAX) is a set of web technologies that execute without interfering with or reloading the website's current state and send and receive data from a client end server asynchronously.
AJAX is not a programming language, framework, or library.


## IMPLEMENTATION
1. Make a function on "views.py" to show the json
2. Make a routing on "urls.py" for the json
3. Add the <script> </script> inside the todolist html file
4. Add the get and post function inside the script tag
5. Add the url inside the function to call the function on "views.py"
6. Create a modal inside the html file
