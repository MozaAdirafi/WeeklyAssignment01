## Describe the difference between asynchronous programming with synchronous programming ?
Synchronous: In Synchronous Transmission,Frames or blocks of data are sent. Full-duplex transmission is being used here. Synchronization between the sender and receiver is necessary.
There is no lag in synchronous transmission when it comes to data.

Asynchronous: In Asynchronous Transmission, Data is transmitted as either bytes or characters. Half-duplex transmission is the type used in this. Start bits and stop bits are combined with the data in this transmission.
It doesn't need to be synchronized.

##  Explain Event-Driven Programming ?
The goal of event-driven programming is to keep the program as straightforward as possible while synchronizing the occurrence of numerous events. 
These are the fundamental elements of an event-driven program:
- When an event is triggered, a callback function (also known as an event handler) is invoked.
- an event loop that calls the appropriate event handler for each event as it is triggered.

## Describe the implementation of asynchronous programming in AJAX
Asynchronous Javascript & XML (AJAX) is a set of web technologies that execute without interfering with or reloading the website's current state and send and receive data from a client end server asynchronously.
AJAX is not a programming language, framework, or library.
